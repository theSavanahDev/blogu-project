# Blogu Project

Blogu is a blogging application with featured and recent posts, categories, articles, author information, comments, and much more.

What's best of all is that you or your clients can manage the blog from a dedicated Content Management System. Built with technologies such as Next.JS, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn/UI, and Vercel.
